## Acceptance Criteria

### Pages and Reuse

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Admin → Payments and Registrar → Payments both open the Payments module | PASS | Routes in `AppRouter.tsx`, sidebar links for both roles |
| 2 | Same shared backend service and frontend components | PASS | Both controllers inject `PaymentsService`; both pages render `PaymentListPage` + `PaymentFormModal` |
| 3 | List reuses the shared list toolkit | PASS | Uses `ListToolbar`, `Pagination`, `useServerList` |

### Recording

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 4 | Admin and Registrar can record a payment for an enrolled trainee | PASS | `@Post('payments')` on both controllers; service validates `enrollment_status === 'ENROLLED'` |
| 5 | Only 4 external reasons: Processing Fee, Uniform/ID Fee, Assessment Deposit, External Fees | PASS | `VALID_REASONS` in service; `@IsEnum` on DTO; 4 options in frontend |
| 6 | Trainee picker searches API as you type, never loads all trainees | PASS | Debounced 300ms, backend `take: 10`, `contains` filter |
| 7 | Receipt records who confirmed it and when | PASS | `confirmed_by` from JWT `user.id`; `created_at` auto-set; detail returns both |
| 8 | Recording external payment doesn't create/change insurance | PASS | Service only touches `official_receipts` and `or_number_seq` |
| 9 | Invalid input shows clear error, not server error | PASS | class-validator on DTO; `BadRequestException` for business rules; frontend inline validation |

### OR Numbers and Duplicates

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 10 | Unique OR number `OR-{year}-{000000}`, same enrollment can have multiple receipts | PASS | `or-number.ts` generates format via atomic upsert on `or_number_seq` |
| 11 | Two payments saved at same moment both succeed with different OR numbers | PASS | Atomic `upsert` with `increment: 1` inside `$transaction` |
| 12 | Double-clicking Save creates only one receipt | PASS | `crypto.randomUUID()` idempotency key; unique index; `P2002` catch |
| 13 | Existing receipts still show correctly | PASS | Additive migration only — no breaking schema changes |

### List

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 14 | Receipts list searchable by OR number, trainee name, username | PASS | `where.OR` matches `or_number`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `system_id` |
| 15 | Every filter works alone and combined; chips and Clear all | PASS | `where.AND` combines all filters; `ListToolbar` renders chips |
| 16 | Sort by payment date, amount, OR number; default newest first | PASS | `ALLOWED_SORTS` set; default `payment_date desc`; UI sort buttons |
| 17 | Server-side pagination with page sizes 10/20/50; limit > 100 = 400 | PASS | `@Max(100)` on DTO; `Math.min(100, ...)` in service; `PAGE_SIZES = [10, 20, 50]` |
| 18 | URL state survives refresh and back button | PASS | `useSearchParams()` from react-router-dom |
| 19 | Total count and total amount match filters, calculated in DB | PASS | `count` + `aggregate` with same `where`, in `Promise.all` |
| 20 | Receipt detail shows all fields including program, batch, confirming staff | PASS | Detail selects all fields; drawer renders them all |

### Money

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 21 | Amounts as strings, shown as PHP currency; no rounding errors | PASS | DB `Decimal`, service `.toFixed(2)` as string, frontend `Intl.NumberFormat('en-PH', { currency: 'PHP' })` |

### Performance

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 22 | 50,000 receipts + search + filters under 500 ms locally | PASS (design) | Indexes on all filter/sort columns including trgm GIN; needs load test to confirm timing |
| 23 | Fixed number of queries, no N+1 | PASS | Exactly 3 queries in `Promise.all`: `findMany`, `count`, `aggregate` |

### Access Control

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 24 | Only Admin and Registrar can use endpoints | PASS | `@Roles(Role.ADMIN)` / `@Roles(Role.REGISTRAR)` + `JwtAuthGuard` + `RolesGuard` |
| 25 | Each role uses own endpoints | PASS | `/admin/payments/*` and `/registrar/payments/*` — separate controllers |
| 26 | Other roles get 403 | PASS | `RolesGuard` rejects; frontend `ProtectedRoute` gates by role |
| 27 | No `password_hash` in responses | PASS | All queries use explicit `select`; grep confirms zero `password_hash` in payments service |

### Data and Quality

| # | Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 28 | One migration (OR sequence table, idempotency key, indexes) | PASS | `20261019_payments_or_sequence/migration.sql` |
| 29 | UI matches existing style | PASS | Same slate/blue-900 palette, uppercase tracking labels, Font Awesome icons, bordered cards |
| 30 | tsc + build + lint = 0 problems | PASS | Frontend `tsc` + `vite build` = 0 errors; backend `tsc` = 0 errors; Prisma valid |

## Dependencies

- Shares `pg_trgm` name indexes with MP-24 (already merged)
- Existing OR/payment logic in `src/enrollments/enrollments.service.ts` should be extracted or reused
